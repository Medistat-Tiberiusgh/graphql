# API Design Assignment

## Project Name

Medistat API

## Objective

Medistat is a GraphQL API for personal medication tracking backed by Swedish national prescription statistics. Users manage their own medication list and, for each drug, receive insights on regional popularity, multi-year trends, and demographic context. All derived from a public national prescribing dataset.

## Implementation Type

GraphQL

## Design Decisions

### Authentication

The API delegates identity to GitHub via OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (RFC 7636, `S256`), then issues its own session token as a JWT.

**OAuth 2.0 with PKCE.** The frontend generates a cryptographically random `code_verifier`, derives a SHA-256 `code_challenge` from it, and stores the verifier in `sessionStorage`. It then redirects the user to GitHub's authorization endpoint with the challenge attached. GitHub redirects back to the frontend with an authorization `code`. The frontend POSTs `{ code, codeVerifier, redirectUri }` to `POST /auth/github/exchange`, where the backend completes the token exchange with GitHub — including the verifier — and, on success, fetches the user's GitHub profile, upserts the user record, and returns a JWT.

**Why PKCE?** It defeats two distinct attacks. The first is OAuth login CSRF: an attacker tricks a victim's browser into completing a flow with the attacker's authorization code, silently logging the victim in as the attacker. The second is authorization code interception. PKCE binds the authorization code to the original initiator — the verifier never leaves the browser that started the flow, so a code redeemed without it is rejected. Modern OAuth guidance (OAuth 2.1 draft) recommends PKCE for all client types, including confidential server-side clients like this one.

**JWT session.** After the exchange the API issues a JSON Web Token signed with HS256 using the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable. The payload contains the user's `sub` (id), `username`, `avatarUrl`, and the optional demographic identifiers `regionId`, `genderId`, and `ageGroupId` (any of which may be `null` for newly-created GitHub users). Embedding these avoids an extra database lookup on every authenticated request. A custom `JwtAuthGuard` validates the token on every protected query/mutation by extracting it from the GraphQL request context, verifying the signature, and attaching the decoded payload to the request. The `@CurrentUser()` parameter decorator then makes the payload available inside resolvers.

**Why JWT?** This addresses issues #3, #7 and #14. JWTs are stateless — the server does not store or coordinate session data — which makes the application easier to scale horizontally since any instance can independently verify a token without consulting a shared session store. The main alternative is server-side session cookies, which are stateful and simpler to invalidate immediately (an advantage JWTs lack without a blocklist), but introduce coordination overhead when scaling across multiple instances.

**Why delegate identity to GitHub?** Authentication is a security-critical operation where misconfiguration leads to data leakage. Delegating identity to a specialized provider offloads password storage, credential rotation, and account recovery to a purpose-built system, leaving the API to handle only authorization (the JWT). The trade-off is that all users must have a GitHub account.

### API Design

**GraphQL students:**

- _How did you design your schema (types, queries, mutations)?_

Through NestJS, the graphql schema is designed through decoraters, keeping implementation and schema in sync by definition.

**Types** Evolved throughout the development of the API. In places where it became obvious that the returned type is a datastructure, the API was changed in order to reflect the data structure type. A neat feature that i discovered throughout the development of the types is that one can add descriptions to them. Descriptions have been used for informing the API consumer about details that would be hard to understand (as for example a deliberate wrapper type `DrugInsights` so future insight dimensions can be added without a breaking change).

**Queries** are split by resource. Reference data is publicly accessible. `myMedications` requires a valid JWT and returns only the authenticated user's data.

**Mutations** are grouped into auth (`deleteAccount`) and medications (`addMedication`, `removeMedication`). All three are protected by the JWT guard. `deleteAccount` requires an explicit `confirm: true` argument to prevent accidental deletion. The login flow itself runs over a REST endpoint (`POST /auth/github/exchange`) rather than a GraphQL mutation — see the Authentication section.

- _How did you implement nested queries? How does the single-endpoint approach affect your design?_

Nested queries are implemented via `@ResolveField` on the `UserMedicationsResolver`. When a client requests `myMedications`, the resolver returns the base `UserMedication` rows. If the client also requests `drugData` or `insights`, NestJS automatically calls the corresponding `@ResolveField` method for each medication, fetching the drug catalog entry or regional statistics lazily. If the client omits those fields, the resolvers are never called.

The single-endpoint model shaped the design in two concrete ways. First, the `DrugInsights` wrapper type exists because the single endpoint invites clients to ask for more over time — wrapping `regionalPopularity` in a type means future dimensions (trends, demographics) can be added as new fields without a breaking change. Second, authorization had to move into the resolver layer rather than the URL layer. Since everything goes through `/graphql`, field-level guards (`@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)`) on the resolver class replace what would otherwise be route-level middleware in a REST API.

### Error Handling

All errors are handled through a custom `AppError` class that extends `GraphQLError`, adding a typed `code` field (for example: `BAD_USER_INPUT´ , `UNAUTHENTICATED`, ´ NOT_FOUND´, `CONFLICT´). These are thrown explicitly throughout the application for known failure conditions.

A global error formatter is implemented as well as a catch-all. If an error is not an `AppError` instance, it is replaced with a generic "Internal server error" response to avoid leaking implementation details. All error responses follow the format:

```JSON
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "User not found.",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "NOT_FOUND"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Core Technologies Used

**NestJS + Apollo Server** — NestJS is an opinionated framework that enforces dependency inversion by design, which aligned well with the course requirements. Apollo Server is integrated to handle the GraphQL layer.

**PostgreSQL** — A relational database was chosen because the dataset has clear relationships between entities (prescriptions, drugs, regions, demographics). PostgreSQL handles the data volume well and integrates cleanly with TypeORM.

**Python seed scripts** — The dataset is large (~46M rows), so preprocessing and seeding is handled by Python scripts (adapted from an existing CSV-to-database tool with AI assistance). Python was kept for its efficiency with large file processing. The scripts and schema are maintained in a separate repository.

**Docker** — Both the seed script and database are containerised. The production environment runs four containers on a shared Docker network: the API, PostgreSQL + seed script, a Caddy reverse proxy (handling TLS certificate renewal via LNU's infrastructure), and a webhook listener that triggers redeployment when the CI/CD pipeline pushes a new image.

**GitHub Actions CI/CD** — On every push to main the pipeline: (1) builds a Docker image and pushes it to GHCR tagged with the commit SHA and `latest`; (2) in parallel, runs the integration suite against a throwaway sample-seeded Postgres. Only if both succeed does it (3) trigger a deploy webhook so the server pulls and restarts the new container, then (4) run the read-only smoke tests against production — rolling back automatically if they fail.

**Tests** — API tests are a Bruno collection (`tests/`) run via the Bruno CLI, split into two tiers by purpose:

- **Pre-deploy integration tests** (`Auth`, `Medications`, `Cleanup`) run in CI against a disposable Postgres seeded from the [db-etl](https://github.com/Medistat-Tiberiusgh/db-etl) sample dataset — the _same_ schema and loader as production, so the authenticated/write logic is verified against a real database without ever writing test data to prod. These gate the deploy.
- **Post-deploy smoke tests** (`Queries`, read-only) run against the live production API to confirm the deployment is healthy and serving correct data; a failure triggers automatic rollback.

Production sign-in is OAuth-only. The `ciToken` mutation that lets the integration suite mint a JWT without a real OIDC round-trip is disabled when `NODE_ENV=prod`, so it can never be an auth backdoor. Bruno was chosen over Postman because Postman cannot export GraphQL collections as plain files, which makes version control and CI integration impractical.

## Reflection

**What was hard?**

The biggest challenge was fully thinking through the dataset before starting implementation. I had a clear idea early on, but as development progressed I realised there were decisions I had not worked out in advance — this led to iterative changes to the seed scripts and PostgreSQL schema mid-development. Schema changes in particular proved disruptive: they broke working code, caused naming to go out of sync across layers, and were time-consuming to untangle.

Implementing GraphQL on the backend was also new territory. I had consumed GraphQL APIs before, but designing and exposing a schema is a different challenge — especially combined with a framework I had not used before.

NestJS and Apollo Server had a steep initial learning curve, but the opinionated structure ultimately made the codebase easier to reason about. I would use both again in future projects.

Setting up Caddy as a reverse proxy in a container was unfamiliar at first, though once it was running it gave me a clearer overview of the server infrastructure than I expected. The custom CD pipeline (webhook-triggered redeployment) was similarly tricky to get right.

**What would I do differently?**

Design the database schema and seed pipeline more carefully before writing any application code. The cost of changing the schema after the fact was much higher than I anticipated — a more thorough upfront design would have saved significant time.
